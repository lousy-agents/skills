# To EARS

## Overview

EARS is a small set of sentence structures for natural-language requirements. Each structure makes visible the conditions, triggers, states, feature applicability, and required response. This skill turns source material into EARS criteria, reviews existing criteria, and derives tests from agreed criteria.

**EARS is a syntax aid.** A well-formed EARS sentence can still be vague, incomplete, contradictory, untestable, or an implementation prescription. This skill reviews meaning as well as form. It never fills a gap with plausible behavior to make a sentence look complete.

This skill is the canonical home of the EARS method in this repository. Other skills delegate to it when it is installed:

- `feature-to-plan` and `issue-refine-loop` each keep a verbatim copy of the compact **EARS Contract**, so they still work without this skill.
- `spec-auditor`'s lint enforces the same contract in code.

References:

- [`references/ears-contract.md`](./references/ears-contract.md) — the canonical contract: the five patterns and their combinations, the criterion line format, provenance tags, binding rules, the open-question format, verification rules, and the vague-term list. **Load first in every mode.**
- [`references/authoring.md`](./references/authoring.md) — choosing a pattern, combining conditions, writing a good requirement, the omission sweep, review checklists, and failure modes. **Load for Draft and Review.**
- [`references/test-derivation.md`](./references/test-derivation.md) — oracles, mapping abstract terms to interfaces, pattern prompts, kinds of evidence, and the task Verification format. **Load for Test map, or when a calling skill needs task verification.**
- [`references/evidence-limits.md`](./references/evidence-limits.md) — what the 2009 and 2025 studies show and do not show. **Load before claiming what EARS achieved.**

## When to Use

- Converting prose requirements, a PRD paragraph, or issue acceptance criteria into EARS
- Reviewing existing EARS criteria for form, meaning, and testability
- Deriving requirement-based tests, or task verification items, from agreed EARS criteria
- Another skill delegates criterion drafting or review (Embedded mode)

**Do NOT use when:**

- The user wants a whole spec file or a new GitHub issue. Use `feature-to-plan`, which calls this skill for its criteria.
- The user wants a whole spec audited for contradictions, scope, and architecture fit. Use `spec-auditor`, which may call this skill for its acceptance-criteria pass.
- The user wants an existing issue rewritten in place. Use `issue-refine-loop`.
- The task is code-level test generation. Use `rugged-evil-tester`, `go-testable-design`, or `mutation-hunter`. This skill stops at a reviewable test mapping.

## Hard Constraints

1. **Separate facts from interpretation.**
   - Every criterion ends with exactly one provenance tag, `[src: …]` or `[inferred: OQ-n]`.
   - An inline `[TBD … — OQ-n]` marks an undecided clause. A `[non-EARS: …]` marker flags a rare exception. Neither replaces the provenance tag.
   - Never present an inference as a quotation of the source.
2. **Never invent.** Add no threshold, unit, trigger, precondition, exclusion, recipient, or behavior that neither the source nor the user established. If making a criterion testable needs a value nobody chose, the fix is a `[TBD …]` marker plus an open question, never a plausible number.
3. **Code is not intent.** Existing code shows what the system does now, not what it is required to do.
4. **Tests come only from agreed criteria.** An `[inferred …]` criterion gets a test only as a draft labeled with its OQ. A `[TBD …]` clause is a coverage gap, never a test.
5. **Never overclaim.** Do not say EARS found all omissions, proved safety, resolved conflicts, established traceability, or guaranteed coverage.
6. **Return output; do not rewrite the source.** Edit or write a file only when the user asks for that file. In Embedded mode, never write: the calling skill owns the artifact.

## Modes

Pick the mode from the request. If the request is unclear, Draft is the default when the input is prose, and Review is the default when the input is already EARS.

**Input.** The input is text, a file you can `Read`, or a conversation. This skill has no GitHub access. Given only an issue number or URL, ask the user to paste the issue text, or ask the calling skill to pass it in.

| Mode | Input | Steps | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Draft** | Prose requirements, a PRD, pasted issue text, or a conversation | 1–6 | Criteria in contract format, open questions, review findings |
| **Review** | Existing criteria (EARS or not) | 1, 3, 5, 6 | Findings per criterion with severity, plus a corrected draft that marks every unresolved clause |
| **Test map** | Agreed criteria, plus interface or code context | 1, 7 | Mapping from criterion to oracle to cases, and the coverage gaps |
| **Embedded** | Another skill calls with a sub-mode (draft, review, or test map), its source text, stories, and component names | As the sub-mode, but unattended | See below |

**Embedded mode** means another skill calls this one.
- Never ask the user anything. Step 6 runs in its unattended form.
- Never write files.
- Return only what the sub-mode produces, with no preamble or summary prose:
  - **draft:** for each story:
    - its criterion lines
    - then a `Notes:` block of plain lines (not nested under a criterion) holding the omission-sweep line, any one-line pattern rationale, and any source-ID mapping

    After the stories, the OQ entries. Nested bullets under a criterion read as extra criteria to the caller's lint.
  - **review:** findings with contract severities, and no rewritten criteria
  - **test map:** verification items in the contract's tagged form
- The caller owns the artifact, the gates, the section layout, and the numbering of stories.

## Procedure

### 1. Establish context

Before rewriting anything, identify each of these. Use `Read`, `Grep`, and `Glob` on any docs, glossary, or interface files the user points to or the repo provides. Record which ones you could not determine:

- **The system boundary and the named responding system(s) or component(s).** Use the agreed names consistently. In a multi-component feature, name the component that owns each response; do not write "the system" for all of them.
- **Actors and event sources.** Who or what produces each trigger.
- **Sources and their identifiers.** Keep the identifiers, and quote or cite the source location for each requirement.
- **Definitions, glossary, interfaces, constraints, product variants.**
- **Requirement level.** Stakeholder, system, or component. EARS was aimed mainly at high-level stakeholder requirements, so check the fit at lower levels.
- **Verification context.** How these criteria will be checked.

### 2. Decompose and classify the source

Separate explicit requirements from implied ones, design guidance, verification statements, rationale, and informative text. For a compound passage, list its distinct obligations, conditions, exceptions, and unwanted scenarios before writing any EARS. Note the source location of each item.

### 3. Sweep for omissions

Run the omission sweep in [`authoring.md`](./references/authoring.md#omission-sweep). Give every relevant prompt a disposition: **covered**, **confirmed by the user**, **out of scope** (with a reason), or **unresolved** (an OQ). The sweep prompts investigation. It is not permission to write criteria.

In Review mode, sweep the existing criteria for what they leave out. Report each gap as a finding; do not draft new criteria for it.

### 4. Choose a pattern and draft

Identify the response first. Then classify what activates it, using the contract table and [`authoring.md`](./references/authoring.md#choosing-a-pattern). Write one obligation per criterion with a consistent system name, using the contract's criterion line format and provenance tags.

When two patterns fit, record a one-line rationale in the notes.

When no pattern fits honestly, use `[non-EARS: <reason>]`, and do not distort the requirement to fit a template.

### 5. Review meaning

Apply the Form, Meaning, and Intent checklists in [`authoring.md`](./references/authoring.md#review-checklists) to every criterion.

- **Form problems:** fix them directly.
- **Meaning and intent problems:** mark the undecided part inline with `[TBD …]` and open an OQ. **Do not resolve them by inventing.**
- **Tags:** change a provenance tag only when the tag itself is wrong. A source-stated criterion you doubt, or would design differently, keeps its `[src]` tag and gets a finding and an OQ.
- **Severity floors:** apply the OQ rules in Output Format before finishing.

Two rules for Review mode:
- **Report, don't redesign.** A corrected draft changes a criterion only to fix a defect found *in that criterion*. Never reassign the responding component, add or drop obligations, or narrow scope because you would design it differently. Raise a finding instead.
- **Omissions belong to the set.** A behavior missing from the whole set is a finding about the set, and its severity comes from the gap. Do not rate a well-formed criterion High because a neighboring behavior is unspecified.

### 6. Validate and trace

- **When the user is available:** ask focused, small-choice questions about every `[inferred …]` criterion and every Blocker or High OQ. Retag each confirmed criterion `[src: user]`.
- **When the user is not available** (unattended runs, and always in Embedded mode): leave the tags and OQs as they are, and state the effect of each unresolved item on the criteria and tests.

Link every criterion to its source, and later to its tests.

### 7. Map tests (Test map mode, or on request)

Follow [`test-derivation.md`](./references/test-derivation.md): oracle, mapping, cases, combinations, setup/action/expected, two-way trace, adequacy. Label each item as requirement-based (with its criterion IDs), `(exploratory)`, `(structural)`, or `(gate)`.

## Output Format

For standalone runs, return these sections:

1. **Context and sources** — the system boundary, named systems, source references, definitions used, and anything you could not determine.
2. **Criteria** — contract-format lines grouped by story or requirement group, with a one-line rationale wherever the pattern choice is debatable.
3. **Open questions, assumptions, and exclusions** — contract-format OQ entries, with severity, the affected criteria, and who must decide. Also list the omission-sweep items judged out of scope, each with its reason.
4. **Review findings** — each with a Blocker/High/Medium/Low severity from the contract. Cover ambiguity, vagueness, compound behavior, omissions to investigate, conflicts, implementation prescriptions, and verification concerns.
   - File each finding under the criterion whose own text is defective.
   - File a gap in the set, meaning a behavior no criterion covers, under **Set** (or the story), never under a well-formed neighbor.
5. **Test mapping** (Test map mode) — criterion ID, abstract conditions and response, the interface mapping, test cases, expected results, and coverage gaps.
6. **Provenance summary** — which items the source establishes, which you inferred, and which you propose.

**Open-question rules, every mode** (Draft, Review, Test map, Embedded). Before finishing, walk the OQ list:
- Each entry is a single line in the contract format: no nested bullets, no wrapped continuation lines.
- Any `assumption` is at least Medium.
- Any OQ that a `[TBD …]` marker points at, or whose open answer leaves an affected criterion with no decidable expected result, is at least High.

For Embedded runs, return only what the sub-mode produces (see Modes). The calling skill places it.

If the source does not support a complete requirement, give the best faithful draft, mark the unresolved clause with `[TBD …]`, and name the exact decision required. Never silently convert uncertainty into a requirement.

## Gotchas

- **"Should" is not "shall".** A source "should" or "may" leaves open whether the requirement binds. Write the criterion with `shall`, tag it `[inferred: OQ-n]`, and ask in OQ-n whether it is mandatory.
- **Do not TBD what the wording already decides.** "Older than 60 minutes" already excludes 60. Raise a boundary only when the source leaves it open.
- **Recount before reporting.** Totals in a summary (findings, OQs by severity) must match the final lists.

- **A source word is not a pattern.** A source "if" is often an event-driven trigger, and a source "when" can describe a state. Classify the behavior, not the word.
- **A flag is a state, not a feature.** A feature flag that can flip at runtime is a `While` state. `Where` is for what ships in a variant.
- **"Make it testable" is the moment fabrication happens.** A reviewer who asks for a number is asking for a decision, so route the request to an OQ.
- **Positive rules do not close themselves.** An allow rule leaves the deny path unspecified until someone specifies it.
- **IDs are load-bearing downstream.** `plan-to-graph` copies task bodies verbatim into child issues, so a task that cites `AC-2.3` must still make sense there. Never renumber an ID after it has been cited.
- **`spec-auditor`'s lint enforces this contract mechanically.** It recognizes the criterion ID prefix, the `During` keyword, `[non-EARS: …]` exemptions, and the vague-term list, and it flags `[TBD …]` markers as unresolved on purpose. A flagged TBD is correct output, not a lint problem to engineer around.
