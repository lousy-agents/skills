# EARS Contract

The same test checks that `spec-auditor/scripts/spec_audit_lint.py` agrees with this block on the vague-term list and on which opening keywords count as EARS. To change the contract, edit this file and every copy in the same PR.

**EARS Contract v1.** The `to-ears` skill (`references/ears-contract.md`) holds the canonical copy of this block. Each consuming skill keeps a verbatim copy, so it still works when installed alone. `tests/test_ears_contract_sync.py` fails CI when a copy drifts, so change every copy in the same PR.

When `to-ears` is installed, use it to draft and review criteria and to derive tests from them. Either way, this block is the minimum every consumer enforces.

**Patterns.** Each criterion uses one of five patterns, or one of the combinations listed below the table.

| Pattern | Template | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubiquitous | The `<system>` shall `<response>`. | The response is required at all times within the system's scope. Do not use it just because the source named no trigger. |
| Event-driven | When `<optional precondition>` `<trigger>`, the `<system>` shall `<response>`. | A wanted event at the system boundary activates the response. |
| Unwanted behavior | If `<optional precondition>` `<unwanted condition>`, then the `<system>` shall `<response>`. | A fault, invalid or unexpected input, misuse, or dependency failure needs a response. A boundary value of wanted behavior is not unwanted behavior. |
| State-driven | While `<state>`, the `<system>` shall `<response>`. `During` may replace `While`. | The response is required for as long as a defined runtime state holds. |
| Optional feature | Where `<feature>` is included, the `<system>` shall `<response>`. | The response applies only to product variants or deployments that include the feature. A runtime mode or flag state is a state, so use `While` for it. |

Combinations keep the clause order Where → While → When/If:

- `While <state>, when <trigger>, the <system> shall …`
- `While <state>, if <unwanted condition>, then the <system> shall …`
- `Where <feature> is included, when <trigger>, the <system> shall …`

Split a combination into linked criteria when it stops being easy to parse.

Choose the pattern from the behavior. Identify the response first, then what activates it. Never choose a pattern because a word such as "if" or "when" appears in the source text.

**Criterion line.** Write each criterion as `- AC-<story>.<n>: <EARS sentence> [<provenance>]`.

- IDs are unique within the artifact.
- Once anything cites an ID, never renumber it.
- When the source has its own identifiers, keep them and record the mapping.

Provenance tags:

- `[src: <issue #, doc path, or "user">]`: the source states it, or the user confirmed it.
- `[inferred: OQ-<n>]`: the agent's interpretation. It is not settled until OQ-<n> is answered.
- `[TBD: <decision needed> — OQ-<n>]`: written inline in place of an undecided value or clause.
- `[non-EARS: <reason>]`: a rare exception for content that no pattern fits, such as a data format. Never use it for a vague criterion.

Examples:

- `- AC-2.1: If a reset link is presented more than 60 minutes after it was issued, then the reset service shall reject it with HTTP 410. [src: #47]`
- `- AC-2.2: When a reset completes, the reset service shall send a confirmation email to the account holder. [inferred: OQ-2]`
- `- AC-2.3: While the mail provider is unavailable, the reset service shall retry delivery for [TBD: retry window — OQ-3]. [src: #47]`

**Binding rules.**

1. **Never invent.** Add no value, threshold, trigger, precondition, exclusion, or behavior that the source or the user did not establish.
   - To make a criterion testable, mark the gap with `[TBD …]` and escalate it. Never fill in a plausible number.
   - Current code behavior is evidence of what exists, not of what is intended.
2. **One obligation per criterion.** Name the responding system or component the same way every time. Do not write "it", and do not switch subjects between lines.
3. **The response is observable.** State units, inclusive or exclusive boundaries, time windows, and the recipient or surface whenever they change the expected result. A vague term (see the list below) needs a measurable definition or a `[TBD …]`.
4. **A positive rule does not imply its negation.** "When an authorized device connects, … allow" says nothing about unauthorized devices.
   - Write the complement only when a source or the user establishes it. Otherwise open an OQ.
   - A `shall not` criterion needs a decidable pass/fail check.
5. **State behavior, not design,** unless the design is an approved constraint. An internal flag or log line is not the user-visible outcome unless it is the agreed proxy for it.
6. **Keep applicability in the criterion.** A condition that changes when a criterion applies belongs in the criterion, not in surrounding notes or prose.
7. **Sweep for omissions before drafting is finished.** Check each of these:
   - invalid, unauthorized, or malformed input
   - missing, stale, or corrupt data
   - dependency failure
   - startup, degraded, recovery, and shutdown states
   - boundaries
   - repeated or concurrent events
   - logging, alerting, and fallback

   Give each relevant prompt a disposition: covered (`AC-…`), out of scope (with a reason), or unresolved (`OQ-…`). The sweep prompts investigation. It does not license writing criteria.
8. **EARS shape is not quality.** A well-formed sentence can still be vague, wrong, compound, or untestable. Review meaning, not form.

**Open questions.** Write each as `- [ ] OQ-<n> (<severity>; question | assumption): <text> — affects: AC-…, Task …; decision needed from: <role>`.

Severity levels:

- **Blocker:** an agent could build the wrong thing, or cannot verify completion.
- **High:** likely failure, such as serious ambiguity, a contradiction, or an untestable criterion.
- **Medium:** may cause rework.
- **Low:** affects clarity only.

**Verification.** Each criterion has an oracle: a setup, a stimulus, and an observable expected result.

Cover these cases for each pattern:

- **Event-driven:** the response occurs when the trigger fires with preconditions held, and does not occur without the trigger.
- **Unwanted behavior:** induce the condition and check the mitigation.
- **State-driven:** the response holds during the state. Also cover entering and leaving the state.
- **Optional feature:** the response in a configuration that includes the feature.
- **Combinations:** the response is withheld when an applicability condition is false, where the spec states that behavior.

Tag each verification item with the criterion IDs it exercises. Otherwise label it `(exploratory)`, `(structural)`, or `(gate)`; use `(gate)` for repo-wide lint and test commands.

A passing suite or a coverage number does not show that a criterion is met.

**Vague terms.** appropriate, as needed, better, easy, efficient, fast, handle, improve, intuitive, normally, optimize, quickly, robust, safe, seamless, secure, simple, sufficient, support, unacceptable, user-friendly
